<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for Xcode 7.1</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Improved compatibility with Finder on OS X 10.11. Starting with OS X 10.11 <code>DesktopServicesHelper</code>, which is running as root, calls <code>stat(2)</code> on behalf of Finder when trying to delete a directory. Blocking this request would result in Finder aborting the delete process.
    </li>
</ul>
